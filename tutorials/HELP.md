# Something not working with this tutorial?

We're sorry you're having a hard time! Let's fix this!

If something in the tutorial isn't working, these are the possible causes:

1. **You have a typo or a mistake somewhere in your code and you didn't follow the tutorial closely enough.**

    The bottom of every tutorial contains a link to the full code of all steps (in the *Conclusion* section). The code is written as an automated test that we run once a week. Compare your code to the test code and try to find where you did something different.

2. **One of the libraries we depend on had a breaking change and the tutorial is out of date.**

    We try to make sure this doesn't happen by running the automated tests once a week. If we see that the tests stop passing, we know we need to fix something. If the automated test isn't passing, there's good chance this is what happened. See if any of the libraries changed recently and install the previous version.

3. **The tutorial has a mistake in it or is written in a confusing way.**

    This can happen, we are only human. Try to investigate the problem and suggest a change in the tutorial to make it more clear for the next person.
